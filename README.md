## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

To run FakePay locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anmollw/FakePay.git
cd FakePay
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and add your MongoDB connection string:

```env
mongodb_url=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, this runs the Express API and connects to your MongoDB instance using the `mongodb_url` environment variable.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file and set the backend API URL:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

> Replace `http://localhost:5000` with the actual backend URL if it's different.

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the React frontend, which communicates with the backend using the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable.

---

Now both your frontend and backend should be running and connected properly!
